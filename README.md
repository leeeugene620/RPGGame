# RPGGame
This is a WIP RPG game made from scratch using Java, JavaFX, and Java AWT.
All images are found in the res folder
All game files are found in the src folder (Run Main.java to open the game)

Currently, I have made a treasure game played with WASD where the objective is to get 3 keys and then open the treasure chest.

Things to implement:
- Game state
- NPC and Dialogue System
- Player Stats
- Monsters (CPU controlled) and Battle System (hit detection from player)
- Inventory System
- Merchant NPC (Buy/Sell Items)
- Title Screen, Game Over Screen
- Environment interaction (cutting trees, raft on ocean?)
- Item Drop
- In-game Menu
- Advanced UI
- New area (map transition)
- Events (Boss fights, other on the road events)
- Save/Load
- Ending Screen
