# RPGGame
This is a WIP RPG game made from scratch using Java, JavaFX, and Java AWT.
All images are found in the res folder
All game files are found in the src folder (Run Main.java to open the game)

Currently, I have made a treasure game played with WASD where the objective is to get 3 keys and then open the treasure chest.
